############# START notes for Stepper Encoder As Servo ########################

Encoder data is being read by the encoder bridge.

Stepper motor came with EA+ EA- and EB+ EB-   I only used EA+ and EB+ connected to the Encoder Bridge AB

Not getting good stepper motor movements.  Lots of stalling.

Will switch code to use same encoders used in the pointing testing
