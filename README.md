OnStep 10.24c and higher appears to have some bugs. I can get the Encoder Bridge to talk to OnStepX, but when i enable tracking or try to move the mount with the arrows the motors do not act right.

Tracking does not enable normally.  AFter a goto or slew to target tracking appears to be enabled.

Just some general strangeness.
